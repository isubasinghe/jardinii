# Microkernel based Operating System 
This is a very simple Operating System built upon the Î¼kernel available [here](https://github.com/isubasinghe/ukernel)
This is very much a WIP project. Currently the kernel is being developed and does not actually jump to the userspace init yet. 
The plan is to implement the trap handlers and IPC code first before any userspace code is written.
